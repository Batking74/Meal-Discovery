      <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 mb-4">
        <h6 class="mb-3 text-primary"><i class="fas fa-user text-primary pe-2"></i>What is the relationship between
          eating healthy and calories?
        </h6>
        <p>
          Calories are your body's source of fuel. We need to refuel our energy supply by eating food. A person should
          aim around 2000 calories
          per day, unless trying to lose weight. Generally high calorie foods indicate a higher amount of salt, sugars,
          and fat. That's why
          it's important to find foods that are naturally high in calories that are a useful and a nutritious inclusion
          to our diet.

        <h6 class="mb-3 text-primary"><i class="fas fa-rocket text-primary pe-2"></i> How important are fruits and

        </h6>

        <h6 class="mb-3 text-primary"><i class="fas fa-home text-primary pe-2"></i> Are foods that contain sugar
          unhealthy?
        </h6>
        <p>Sugars can be an enemy to a healthy diet. Yet it is important to address the difference between natural and
          added sugars
          for a healthy diet. Sugars are carbs which provide a vital source of energy and nutrition, yet many popular
          foods have sugar added to them, this is when sugars become unhealthy. Fruits and some vegetables contain
          naturally occurring sugars which are considered healthy when not consumed in overly excessive amounts, but
          added sugars provide nearly no nutritional value and contribute significantly to weight gain, damaging your
          health diet. It is therefore important to check the labels to ensure no products contain hidden added sugars.

        <h6 class="mb-3 text-primary"><i class="fas fa-book-open text-primary pe-2"></i> How can you achieve a healthy
          diet?</h6>
        <p>
          The general rules for healthy eating is that natural foods are generally healthy, and if a product has been
          overly processed it may contain unhealthy ingredient such as added sugars or bad fats. Cutting down on sugars,
          fats, and salt is a good place to start when changing a diet and instead replace them with natural products such
          as fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains and so on.
